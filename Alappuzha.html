              <p class="card-text">Located near the Sea Bridge and at the distance of 4 km from the Alappuzha town in Kerala, there resides a 150 year old towering Alappuzha Lighthouse. Built in the year 1862, it was one of the fussiest ports and trade centre of Kerala during that time. It is one of the oldest lighthouses on the south-west coast of India.

                HISTORY
                The lighthouse construction was started while during the rule of Marthanda Varma- II Maharaja and was completed during the rule of Rama Varma Maharaja of Travancore. The first stone was laid here by the wife of the Port Officer Huge Crawford on 26th April, 1860 and it was commissioned on 28th March 1862 by Ms Francis Newcombe Maltby who was the wife of the Resident Francis Newcombe.
                
                
                The lighthouse at Alappuzha is constructed using laterite stones and teak. Earlier, it had a coconut oil, double-wick lamp that was used till 1952 and then it was later reinstated by 500 mm drum optic and DA gas flasher. Then in the year 1960, the old equipments were changed again by a direct drive system and an emergency lantern of 300 mm. Later on, 230V Metal Halide Lamp was finally replaced in the year 1999.
                
                TIMINGS
                The lighthouse remains open from 3 PM to 5 PM every day.

              <p class="card-text">Palaces are living legacies left behind by departed kings. They tell us many stories and let us have glimpses of a past when palaces were glorious power centers. Krishnapuram Palace too has its own tales to tell and things to show.

                Located in the district of Alappuzha in Kerala, near the town of Kayamkulam, Krishnapuram Palace was built in the 18th century by Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the ruler of the former princely state of Travancore. He built it after Kayamkulam was conquered and made a part of Travancore. The palace is situated near the Sree Krishnaswamy Temple in the village of Krishnapuram and can be accessed via NH 47 between the towns of Ochira and Kayamkulam. It sits atop a small hill, and is surrounded by lawns and ponds and a terraced garden.
                
                Krishnapuram Palace is built in the conventional architectural style of Kerala with gabled low roofs, narrow corridors, thick-framed doors, and dormer windows. It is built in the Pathinaru-kettu (16 blocks) style, in which rooms are built around four inner courtyards called Nadu-muttams.At the time when the building was occupied by the royal family, it was a large complex consisting of many units.</p>
