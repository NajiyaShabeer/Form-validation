              <p class="card-text">Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge  - Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala. 1,600 m above sea level, this hill station was once the summer resort of the erstwhile British Government in South India. One of the most sought after honeymoon destinations in Kerala, Munnar is replete with resorts and lodging facilities that fit a wide rage of budgets. Sprawling tea plantations, picturesque towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities make this a popular resort town. Among the exotic flora found in the forests and grasslands here is the Neelakurinji. This flower which bathes the hills in blue once in every twelve years, will bloom next in 2030. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anamudi, which towers over 2,695 m. </p>

              <p class="card-text">Eravikulam National Park is located in the Southern Western Ghats near Idukki, Kerala. The name Eravikulam translates to streams and pools, which is the best description of the national park. The area of the park used to be managed as a Game Preserve till 1978 when the Government of Kerala elevated its status to that of a National Park.

                The area of the park was home to the now highly endangered Nilgiri Tahr. It was placed under protection in this habitat in 1975. Eravikulam National park is spread over an area of 92 square kilometers and is covered with high altitude grasslands.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Anamudi, the 2,695-m high mountain which stands tall in the Eravikulam National Park is the pride of Kerala. It is the highest point in India outside the Himalayan Mountain Ranges. Anamudi, together with the Eravikulam Park, is home to one of the largest surviving populations of Asian elephants, Gaurs and the Nilgiri Tahrs. The mountain, covered with evergreen forests and inhabited by endemic flora and fauna and a vibrant avian life, is a paradise in the wild. The green forest is also the source of some large and scenic rivers in Kerala and the nearby State of Tamil Nadu.

Situated at a height of 1700 m above sea level, Mattupetty is known for its storage masonry dam and the beautiful lake, which offers pleasurable boat rides, enabling one to enjoy the surrounding hills and landscape. Mattupetty's fame is also attributed to the dairy farm run by the Indo-Swiss Livestock Project, where one can encounter different high yielding breeds of cows.Located in the Idukki district of the South Indian state of Kerala, the Mattupetty Dam is more than just a water storage facility. The water body that forms as a result of this gravity dam is often termed as Mattupetty Lake.</p>
